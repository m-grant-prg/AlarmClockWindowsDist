1 ... Project Description
=========================

This is an Advanced Installer project to produce an msi package for the AlarmClock project. The AlarmClock project is a GUI AlarmClock application implementing two independent alarms. Each alarm can be set to 'Alarm At', eg 13:15, or 'Alarm In', eg 1 hour 10 mins. Each alarm also incorporates a 'Snooze' button that will pause a ringing alarm for 5 minutes.

If you are looking for a Linux type distribution package, an associated GitHub repository AlarmClockAutoToolsDist is available. This repository provides the mechanism to produce an AutoTools tarball package.
