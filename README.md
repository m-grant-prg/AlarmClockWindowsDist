1 ... Project Description
=========================

This is a Windows Installer packaging project for a GUI AlarmClock application 
implementing two independent alarms. Each alarm can be set to 'Alarm At', 
eg 13:15, or 'Alarm In', eg 1 hour 10 mins. Each alarm also incorporates a 
'Snooze' button that will pause a ringing alarm for 5 minutes.

The actual application source code is maintained in the following repository:-
